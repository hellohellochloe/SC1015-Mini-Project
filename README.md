# SC1015-Mini-Project
Contributors to Food Organic Waste Repository
AboutThis is a mini project for SC1015. Our dataset is from Kaggle, (insert link). We will be going through the following: 
1. Data extraction
2. Data visualisation
3. Data splitting
4. Data analysis
5. Conclusion

Problem Definition
1. What contributes to food organic waste levels?
2. Which is the most significant factor that does so?

Models
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier

Conclusion
1. GDP is the most significant factor contributing to high food organic waste levels. 2. GDP has an inverse relationship with food organic wastage.

Lessons learnt
1. Using stack bar charts to check balance/imbalance of data
2. Random Forest Regressor to conduct multivariate analysis across multiple variables simultaneously
3. Using F and probability (p) values to determine the significance of different factors in affecting a certain outcome (food organic waste)
4. Predicting NA values using linear regression
5. Collaboration using GitHub and Jupyter Notebook
