# SC1015-Mini-Project
# Contributors to Food Organic Waste Repository

## About
This is a mini project for SC1015. Our dataset is from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zvr842/global-pollution-by-counties. We will be going through the following: 
1. Data extraction
2. Data cleaning
3. Tackling imbalanced data (categorical)
4. Data analysis (univariate, bivariate, multivariate)
5. Conclusion

## Problem Definition   
1. Contributing factors to high food organic waste levels
  - Gdp
  - Recycling percentage
  - Presence of national law
  - Presence of enforcement

2. Significance of identified factors contributing to high food organic waste levels

3. The most significant factor contributing to high food organic waste levels 

## Models 
1. Linear Regression   
2. Binary Classification  
3. Random Forest Regressor 

## Conclusion
1. GDP is the most significant factor contributing to high food organic waste levels. 
2. GDP has an inverse relationship with food organic wastage.

## Lessons learnt
1. Predicting NA values using linear regression and binary classification
2. Using stacked bar charts to check if there is a relationship between food organic waste and the categorical variables
3. Random Forest Regressor to conduct multivariate analysis across multiple variables (both numerical and categorical) simultaneously
4. Using F and probability (p) values to determine the significance of different factors in affecting a certain outcome (food organic waste)
5. Collaboration using GitHub and Jupyter Notebook
