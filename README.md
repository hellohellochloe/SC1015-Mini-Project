# SC1015-Mini-Project
# Contributors to Food Organic Waste Repository

## About
This is a mini project for SC1015. Our dataset is from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zvr842/global-pollution-by-counties. We will be going through the following: 
1. Data extraction
2. Data visualisation
3. Data splitting
4. Data analysis
5. Conclusion

## Problem Definition
1. What contributes to food organic waste levels?
2. Which is the most significant factor that does so?

## Models
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Regressor

## Conclusion
1. GDP is the most significant factor contributing to high food organic waste levels. 
2. GDP has an inverse relationship with food organic wastage.

## Lessons learnt
1. Using stacked bar charts to check the significance of variables when data is imbalanced
2. Random Forest Regressor to conduct multivariate analysis across multiple variables (numerical and categorical) simultaneously
3. Using F and probability (p) values to determine the significance of different factors in affecting a certain outcome (food organic waste)
4. Predicting NA values using linear regression
5. Collaboration using GitHub and Jupyter Notebook
